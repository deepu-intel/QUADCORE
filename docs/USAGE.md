# QuadCore Synthesis Engine – Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the QuadCore Synthesis Engine to combine three high‑quality ORES‑formatted responses into a single master response. QuadCore is the final stage of a cognitive pipeline; it works best when you also provide upstream analyses (CAA, REM, REM‑2) from the same original user query.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using QuadCore, you need:

1. **Three ORES‑formatted responses**  
   These are the outputs of running three different refined prompts through the ORES (or ORCA) execution engine. Each response should follow the ORES structure (Problem Restatement, Core Mechanism, Execute SOP, etc.). If your responses are not in ORES format, QuadCore will still attempt to synthesize them, but results may be less structured.

2. **(Optional) Upstream analyses**  
   - **CAA** – Cognitive Profile Analysis (user IQ/EQ/SQ, stage, problem value, hierarchy)  
   - **REM** – Reverse Engineering Matrix (UEQ, known/unknown questions, core driver, blind spot)  
   - **REM‑2** – Equilibrium Balancer (paired questions, energy imbalance, balancing actions, critical inclusions)  
   These analyses must come from the **same original user query** that generated the three refined prompts. They provide deep personalization.

## Step‑by‑Step Instructions

### 1. Gather Your Inputs
Collect the three ORES responses. If you have upstream analyses, have them ready. Name them clearly (e.g., `Response 1`, `Response 2`, `Response 3`, `CAA Analysis`, `REM Analysis`, `REM‑2 Analysis`).

### 2. Open the QuadCore Engine
Copy the entire contents of [`QUADCORE.md`](QUADCORE.md) – this is the meta‑prompt that tells the LLM how to synthesize. Paste it into a conversation with a capable LLM (e.g., GPT‑4, Claude, DeepSeek).

### 3. Paste Your Inputs
At the end of the prompt, after the line `*[Paste your inputs here: ...]*`, paste your three ORES responses and any optional analyses. Clearly label them, for example:

```
Response 1:
[full text of response 1]

Response 2:
[full text of response 2]

Response 3:
[full text of response 3]

CAA Analysis:
[full text of CAA]

REM Analysis:
[full text of REM]

REM-2 Analysis:
[full text of REM-2]
```

### 4. Run the Engine
Submit the prompt. The LLM will execute the QuadCore protocol and generate a master response in the specified ORES format.

### 5. Review and Refine
Examine the output. Use the self‑validation checklist in the protocol to ensure quality. If needed, you can iterate by feeding the output back with additional instructions.

## Example (Simplified)

**User query:** *“How do I choose between deterministic and probabilistic summarization?”*

**Three refined prompts** (generated by ORCA) lead to three ORES responses covering:
- Response A: Decision matrix and scoring.
- Response B: Fallback architectures and metrics.
- Response C: Identity reframing and career advice.

**Upstream analyses (optional):**
- CAA: User has high IQ, medium EQ, in Intellectual stage, problem value = Silver.
- REM: UEQ = “How to choose?”; blind spot = “human‑in‑the‑loop for high‑consequence tasks.”
- REM‑2: Energy imbalance (positive/negative) requires reality anchors.

**QuadCore output** integrates all three responses, tailors the tone to the user’s profile, explicitly addresses the blind spot, and includes reality anchors to balance optimism. The final guide is comprehensive and immediately actionable.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Quality in, quality out.** Ensure your three ORES responses are themselves well‑crafted. QuadCore synthesizes; it cannot fix bad inputs.
- **Use upstream analyses whenever possible.** They dramatically improve personalization and reduce follow‑up questions.
- **Be explicit about missing analyses.** If you don’t provide CAA, REM, or REM‑2, note it in the input so the engine adjusts accordingly.
- **Iterate if needed.** The first output may need slight adjustments; you can ask the LLM to refine specific sections.

## Integration with the Full Pipeline

QuadCore is designed to be the final step in this pipeline:

```
Raw User Query
    ↓
[CAA] – Cognitive profiling
    ↓
[REM] – Reverse engineering question matrix
    ↓
[REM‑2] – Equilibrium balancing
    ↓
[ORES/ORCA] – Generate three refined prompt‑response pairs
    ↓
[QuadCore] – Synthesize into one master response
```

If you have built the preceding systems, QuadCore will seamlessly consume their outputs. If not, you can still use QuadCore with any three well‑structured responses.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Output is disjointed | Input responses vary wildly in structure or quality | Ensure all three ORES responses follow the same format; improve their quality |
| Blind spot not addressed | REM analysis missing or not used | Provide REM analysis or manually note the blind spot |
| Output too long/too short | No depth/brevity guidance | Add a note in the input (e.g., “Keep it concise”) |
| Output feels generic | No upstream analyses | Supply CAA/REM/REM‑2 for personalization |
